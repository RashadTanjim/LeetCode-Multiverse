Explanation:

    Combining and Sorting Jobs:
        We create a 2D array jobs where each element is a pair [difficulty, profit].
        Sort jobs by difficulty.

    Sorting Workers:
        Sort the worker array to process workers in increasing order of their ability.

    Tracking Maximum Profit:
        Use maxProfit to keep track of the highest profit we can achieve for jobs with difficulty up to the current job being considered.
        Iterate through the worker array, and for each worker, update maxProfit to the best profit available for the jobs they can do.
        Add maxProfit to totalProfit for each worker.

    Assigning Jobs:
        For each worker, find all jobs they can do (jobs with difficulty less than or equal to the worker's ability).
        Update the maximum profit for the current set of jobs and add this profit to the total profit.

This approach ensures we efficiently match workers to the best jobs they can perform, maximizing the total profit while maintaining an overall time complexity of O(nlog⁡n+mlog⁡m)O(nlogn+mlogm), which is efficient given the problem constraints.
