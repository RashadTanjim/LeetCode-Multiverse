Explanation of the Code

    Sorting: position.sort() ensures that the positions are in ascending order, making it easier to calculate distances between consecutive positions.
    Binary Search: low is initialized to 1 (minimum possible force), and high is initialized to the maximum possible distance (difference between the maximum and minimum positions).
    Greedy Check Function: canPlaceBalls(min_force) checks if it's possible to place m balls with at least min_force distance between any two balls.
        It starts by placing the first ball and then tries to place each subsequent ball at the next valid position.
        If it successfully places all m balls, it returns True; otherwise, False.
    Binary Search Execution: The while loop performs the binary search, adjusting low and high based on whether the current mid value is feasible. The best feasible force found during the search is stored in best.
    Result: The maximum feasible minimum force is returned as the result.

This approach ensures that we find the maximum possible minimum magnetic force efficiently using binary search and greedy checking.
